### FragmentCut

FragmentCut is a likelihood based method for the detection of long DNA fragments from dilution pool sequencing experiments (e.g. fosmid pooling, CGI LFR). FragmentCut identifies haplotype fragments that can subsequently be assembled into haplotype blocks using HapCUT2 or other tools. It is currently unpublished.
