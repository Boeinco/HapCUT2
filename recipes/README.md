HapCUT2 Recipes: Sample pipelines to assemble haplotypes from various sequencing data types
======

##About:
This directory contains example pipelines for assembling haplotypes using
various types of sequencing data. Each pipeline is self-contained
except for dependencies on HapCUT2 and related software, various common
bioinformatics tools, and the input data.
Each pipeline is in a separate directory as described here:

- **HiC:** Hi-C (proximity ligation) reads
- **10X:** 10X genomics gemcode linked-reads
- **HiC_10X:** HiC + 10X combination
