This repository holds the code for a new haplotype assembly method that uses a likelihood model for haplotype assembly and is efficient for long read and Hi-C sequence technologies. The manuscript describing these improvements and a comparison to other tools for haplotype assembly will be available soon (currently in submission). 

The tarball of the source code (hapcut2.tar.gz) can be downloaded here. The latest source code is available from  https://github.com/pjedge/hapcut2
