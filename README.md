This repository holds the code for a new version of HapCUT that uses a likelihood model for haplotype assembly and is efficient for long read and Hi-C sequence technologies. The manuscript describing these improvements and a comparison to other tools for haplotype assembly is currently under preparation. 

The tarball of the source code (hapcut2.tar.gz) can be downloaded here. The latest source code is available from  https://github.com/pjedge/hapcut2
