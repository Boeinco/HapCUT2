This repository holds the code for a new haplotype assembly method, HapCUT2, that uses a likelihood model for haplotype assembly and is efficient for long read and Hi-C sequence technologies. The manuscript describing these improvements and a comparison to other tools for haplotype assembly has been published recently in Genome Research: http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2016/12/09/gr.213462.116.abstract 

The tarball of the source code (hapcut2.tar.gz) can be downloaded here. The latest source code is available from  https://github.com/pjedge/hapcut2
